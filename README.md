# Remove MFC Comments

## Introduction

RemoveMfcComments is a small C# tool to remove recursively obsolete MFC ClassWizard comments from source files.

The MFC ClassWizard in Visual Studio 2015 and newer doesn't use many of the legacy ClassWizard MFC comments in the source code. These ClassWizard comments make however the code harder to read. This tool removes all the old and obsolete MFC ClassWizard comments.
